## Acknowledgments
I am grateful to [Dr. Deborah Sterns](https://deborahstearns.blogspot.com/), [Joscelin Rocha-Hidalgo](https://www.joscelinrocha.com/), and the [Georgetown Center for New Designs in Learning & Scholarship (CNDLS)](https://cndls.georgetown.edu/) for allowing me to use their teaching resources throughout the development of this syllabus. The format of this course was largely inspired by the [MIND Computational Summer School](https://mindsummerschool.org/), [Neuromatch Academy](https://neuromatch.io/academy/), Dr. Maximilian Risenhuber's Computational Neuroscience course, Dr. Robert C. Wilson's [Modeling the Mind course](http://u.arizona.edu/~bob/web_NSCS344/), Dr. Luke J. Chang's [DartBrains Jupyter Book](https://dartbrains.org/content/intro.html), the research conducted in the [Laboratory on Social and Affective Neuroscience](https://abigailmarsh.com/lab), and the countless conversations with my colleagues about the selected topics.
