# Final Project Guidelines

Determining a research question and coming up with a study to answer the question is an iterative process. It is a multi-step process that requires constant feedback from peers/advisors.

The final project will serve as an smaller-scale example of the steps involved in creating a research study, and will assess your cumulative comprehension of the course material. It comprises four parts:
1. Project Proposal - Round 1 (5%)
2. Annotated Bibliography (10%)
3. Project Proposal - Round 2 (15%)
4. Project Presentation (20%)

### Project Proposal - Round 1
Students will submit a 250-300 word abstract describing their research question and study idea. They should set up a meeting with the instructor (during office hours) to determine a final project. Upon completion of this assignment, students will receive feedback and suggestions on how to improve their study and should incorporate this feedback into their proposal (round 2).

### Annotated Bibliography
Students will choose 7-10 research articles and summarize the research questions, methods, and results of each paper (behavior only). Students should also include a 2-3 sentences on each paper's relevance to their final project.

### Project Proposal - Round 2
Students will expand their 250-300 word abstract based on feedback from the instructor. Their project proposal should be 2-3 pages (in [APA format](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/general_format.html)) on a hypothetical research study. This should include:
- Introduction with research question and hypothesis/hypotheses
- Methods
- Expected results

Student will receive feedback on their proposals and should incorporate it before their final project presentation.

### Project Presentation
This presentation will be the "final exam" of this course. Students will present their project proposal to the class (10 minutes each) and determine 2-3 questions for a quick class discussion (5-10 minutes).
