abstract = {A fundamental question in psychology and neuroscience is the extent to which cognitive and neural processes are specialised for social behaviour, or are shared with other ‘non-social' cognitive, perceptual, and motor faculties. Here we apply the influential framework of Marr (1982) across research in humans, monkeys, and rodents to propose that information processing can be understood as ‘social' or ‘non-social' at different levels. We argue that processes can be socially specialised at the implementational and/or the algorithmic level, and that changing the goal of social behaviour can also change social specificity. This framework could provide important new insights into the nature of social behaviour across species, facilitate greater integration, and inspire novel theoretical and empirical approaches.},

abstract = {Computational modeling of behavior has revolutionized psychology and neuroscience. By fitting models to experimental data we can probe the algorithms underlying behavior, find neural correlates of computational variables and better understand the effects of drugs, illness and interventions. But with great power comes great responsibility. Here, we offer ten simple rules to ensure that computational modeling is used with care and yields meaningful insights. In particular, we present a beginner-friendly, pragmatic and details-oriented introduction on how to relate models to data. What, exactly, can a model tell us about the mind? To answer this, we apply our rules to the simplest modeling techniques most accessible to beginning modelers and illustrate them with examples and code available online. However, most rules apply to more advanced techniques. Our hope is that by following our guidelines, researchers will avoid many pitfalls and unleash the power of computational modeling on their own data.},

@article{Blohm2020,
abstract = {Within neuroscience, models have many roles, including driving hypotheses, making assumptions explicit, synthesizing knowledge, making experimental predictions, and facilitating applications to medicine. While specific modeling techniques are often taught, the process of constructing models for a given phenomenon or question is generally left opaque. Here, informed by guiding many students through modeling exercises at our summer school in CoSMo (Computational Sensory-Motor Neuroscience), we provide a practical 10-step breakdown of the modeling process. This approach makes choices and criteria more explicit and replicable. Experiment design has long been taught in neuroscience; the modeling process should receive the same attention.},

@misc{Charpentier2018,
abstract = {Interactions with conspecifics are key to any social species. In order to navigate this social world, it is crucial for individuals to learn from and about others. From learning new skills by observing parents perform them to making complex collective decisions, understanding the mechanisms underlying social cognitive processes has been of considerable interest to psychologists and neuroscientists. Here, we review studies that have used computational modelling techniques, combined with neuroimaging, to shed light on how people learn and make decisions in social contexts. As opposed to standard social neuroscience methods, the computational approach allows one to directly examine where in the brain particular computations, as estimated by models of behavior, are implemented. Findings suggest that people use several strategies to learn from others: vicarious reward learning, where one learns from observing the reward outcomes of another agent; action imitation, which relies on encoding a prediction error between the expected and actual actions of the other agent; and social inference, where one learns by inferring the goals and intentions of others. These computations are implemented in distinct neural networks, which may be recruited adaptively depending on task demands, the environment and other social factors.},

@article{Zhang2019,
abstract = {The recent years have witnessed a dramatic increase in the use of reinforcement learning (RL) models in social, cognitive and affective neuroscience. This approach, in combination with neuroimaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging, enables quantitative investigations into latent mechanistic processes. However, increased use of relatively complex computational approaches has led to potential misconceptions and imprecise interpretations. Here, we present a comprehensive framework for the examination of (social) decision-making with the simple Rescorla–Wagner RL model. We discuss common pitfalls in its application and provide practical suggestions. First, with simulation, we unpack the functional role of the learning rate and pinpoint what could easily go wrong when interpreting differences in the learning rate. Then, we discuss the inevitable collinearity between outcome and prediction error in RL models and provide suggestions of how to justify whether the observed neural activation is related to the prediction error rather than outcome valence. Finally, we suggest posterior predictive check is a crucial step after model comparison, and we articulate employing hierarchical modeling for parameter estimation. We aim to provide simple and scalable explanations and practical guidelines for employing RL models to assist both beginners and advanced users in better implementing and interpreting their model-based analyses.},

Immense progress has been made, but the complexities of each field, which can multiply when combined, present a significant obstacle. A carefully defined framework for integration is needed. The shift towards computational modeling in decision science provides a powerful basis and a path forward, but one whose synergistic potential will only be fully realized by drawing on the theoretical richness of the affective sciences. Reviewing research using a popular computational model of choice (the drift diffusion model), we discuss how mapping concepts to parameters reduces conceptual ambiguity and reveals novel hypotheses.},

abstract = {This paper reviews progress in the application of computational models to personality, developmental, and clinical neuroscience. We first describe the concept of a computational phenotype, a collection of parameters derived from computational models fit to behavioral and neural data. This approach represents individuals as points in a continuous parameter space, complementing traditional trait and symptom measures. One key advantage of this representation is that it is mechanistic: The parameters have interpretations in terms of cognitive processes, which can be translated into quantitative predictions about future behavior and brain activity. We illustrate with several examples how this approach has led to new scientific insights into individual differences, developmental trajectories, and psychopathology. We then survey some of the challenges that lay ahead.},

@article{Hutcherson2015,
abstract = {We propose a neurocomputational model of altruistic choice and test it using behavioral and fMRI data from a task in which subjects make choices between real monetary prizes for themselves and another. We show that a multi-attribute drift-diffusion model, in which choice results from accumulation of a relative value signal that linearly weights payoffs for self and other, captures key patterns of choice, reaction time, and neural response in ventral striatum, temporoparietal junction, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. The model generates several novel insights into the nature of altruism. It explains when and why generous choices are slower or faster than selfish choices, and why they produce greater response inTPJ and vmPFC, without invoking competition between automatic and deliberative processes or reward value for generosity. It also predicts that when one's own payoffs are valued more than others', some generous acts may reflect mistakes rather than genuinely pro-social preferences. Hutcherson etal. show that a computational model of altruism accounts for behavioral and neural effects attributed to self-control and/or the value of generosity, without requiring either. The model suggests that some generosity represents choice errors, not genuine social preferences.},
