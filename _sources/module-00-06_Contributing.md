One of the best aspects of the computational modeling, Python, and open psych/neuroscience communities is the strong committment to developing and sharing content, tools, and knowledge to benefit trainees and other community members! 

The goals of this course (as outlined in the [syllabus](https://shawnrhoads.github.io/gu-psyc-347/module-00-00_Syllabus.html#course-goals)) were:

1. Understand the following: what are computational models, why use computational models, when to use computational models, and how data are fit to models.
2. Survey selected topics on social behavior through lectures, readings, discussions, and hands-on tutorials
3. Learn how to write code for data science using the Python programming language and Jupyter Notebooks
4. Work collaboratively to “fit” data to models and evaluate their performance
5. Interpret the results of a social behavioral experiment
6. Gain a richer understanding of how computational modeling advances psychological science

While I tried to incorporate a diverse curriculum to introduce undergraduate students to the basics of modeling in the context of social behavior, there is still so much I left out (and still much unknown in this growing field). That being said, I would absolutely love to improve and expand the content included in this Jupyter Book to utility beyond this course, especially with your help!

Here are some ways you can help me accomplish this goal!
- If you spot an error (e.g., typo, bug, inaccurate descriptions, etc.), please [open a new issue](https://github.com/shawnrhoads/gu-psyc-347/issues/new?title=Issue%20on%20page%20:%20*.html&body=Your%20issue%description%20here.) on GitHub.
- If I had inadvertently omitted credit for any content generated by others, please also let me know.
- If you have an idea for a tutorial or a new module to include (especially related to the [readings](https://shawnrhoads.github.io/gu-psyc-347/module-00-03_Reading-List.html)), please either [open a new issue](https://github.com/shawnrhoads/gu-psyc-347/issues/new?title=Tutorial%20Idea:%20[INSERT%20TITLE]&body=Please%20suggest%20a%20tutorial%20idea%20here%20with%20any%20relevant%20resources.) and/or submit a pull request directly to the repository on GitHub.
