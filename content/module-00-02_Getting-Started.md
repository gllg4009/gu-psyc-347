# Getting Started

## Download Anaconda 3
Anaconda is an open-source distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing. We will be using it throughout the course.

## Clone repository
In your terminal, use command: `git clone https://github.com/shawnrhoads/gu-psyc-347`

## Create Anaconda environment
Once the download completes, change your directory to 'gu-psyc-347' using the command: `cd gu-psyc-347`

Then create a new Anaconda environment using: `conda env create -f environment.yml`
