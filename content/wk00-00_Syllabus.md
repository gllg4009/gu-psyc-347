## Course Overview

The goal of <u>computational modeling</u> in behavioral and psychological science is using precise mathematical models to make better sense of behavioral data {cite}`Wilson2019`. This practice has revolutionized psychological science and neuroscience by allowing researchers to test specific theories and hypotheses or explain unobservable aspects of complex social cognitive processes and behaviors. 

This course is ideal for advanced students in psychological science, cognitive neuroscience, or computer science with some background in psychology, research methods, and programming, but welcomes students with all levels of experience.

<b>Some definitions</b>

<u>Behavior</u>: choices, reaction times, eye movements, or other easily observable behaviors

<u>Models</u>: mathematical equations that link the experimentally observable variables (e.g. stimuli, outcomes, past experiences) to behavior in the immediate future
</div>

## Course Goals
1. Learn about the goals and concepts underlying computational modeling 
2. Survey selected topics through discussions, readings, and hands-on tutorials (these topics will span a broad set of social psychological abilities including observational learning, social inference and impression updating, cooperative decision-making, and social influence)
3. Gain experience working with real data using the Python programming language
4. Work collaboratively to fit/evaluate models
5. Finish the semester with a richer understanding of how computational modeling advances psychological science

## Course Policies

### Inclusion

I value our diverse student body and am committed to fostering an equitable classroom environment. I invite you, if you wish, to tell me how you want to be referred to both in terms of your name and your pronouns (he/him, she/her, they/them, etc.). Additionally, it is your choice whether you disclose how you identify in terms of your gender, race, class, sexuality, religion, and dis/ability, among all aspects of your identity. I will do my best to address and refer to all students accordingly, and I ask you to do the same for all of your fellow students. 

### Materials and Resources

Students can access all readings, lectures, and materials on [Canvas]() or on the [course webpage](). If there are any changes made to this syllabus, an email will be sent out accordingly.

<u>All software used in this class is open-source (a.k.a. free)</u>! However, students will need a working laptop computer for class. If you would like to take out a computer loan, you can do so at [Lauinger Library](https://www.library.georgetown.edu/computing/laptops).

### Course Etiquette
Please be nice and respectful to everyone in class. Don't cheat or plagiarize. We will be following the Georgetown [Code of Conduct](https://studentconduct.georgetown.edu/code-of-student-conduct/). I am pretty flexible with grading and course expectations as long as students are honest.

### Late Submissions
For assignments that are submitted late, the maximum obtainable grade will be reduced by 10% for each day it is late. For instance, if one receives 9/10 points on an assignment that is three days late, one will receive 6.3/10 points instead. 

### Extra Credit
You may earn extra credit up to 3% to your total grade. There are two ways to obtain extra credit: (1) Research Participation through the [Georgetown Research Volunteer Program](https://georgetown.sona-systems.com/all_exp.aspx) and/or (2) submitting a one-page reflection from the optional reading list. Completing each earns one extra credit point. For example, you may obtain 2 research participation credits and complete 1 article reflection for a total of 3 extra credit points. You may also obtain a total of 3 research participation credits.

## Resources

If you experience sexual violence, identity-based harm, or any other personal crisis at any point during the course, please do not hesitate to reach out to (1) help you catch up with course material, (2) put you in contact with the appropriate resources and services, and (3) answer questions to the extent that I am qualified to do so. If you would rather not talk to me about these issues, here are some of the resources I would have been sharing with you anyways.

I am committed to supporting survivors of sexual misconduct, including relationship violence and sexual assault. Due to federal law, I must report any disclosures of sexual misconduct to the Title IX Office. I want to be able to protect you as best as I can, and in this case, it would be to report the survivor’s story to the appropriate authorities.

Did you know that Georgetown University has its own food pantry? They have non-perishable food and personal hygiene products. During the period of online instructions, they relocated to McShain Kitchen, adjacent to McShain Large. You just need your GoCard to access. If you encounter any problems getting in, contact GUPD at 202-687-4343.
